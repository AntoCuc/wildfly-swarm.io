## Community

WildFly Swarm is open source software with a vibrant community. Our community values
contributions from all its members, as such we have a
**[Code of Conduct](/community/code-of-conduct)**.

If you are interested in contributing to WildFly Swarm, that's great! We love
contributions! To help make it easier getting started, we have a
**[contribution guide](/community/contributing)** on how to setup your environment and
submit changes for review.

If you are getting started and have questions, would like to contribute
to the development of the project, or just want to chat with other users and
developers, join us on Freenode or our Google Group.
