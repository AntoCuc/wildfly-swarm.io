== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular 
WildFly Java Application Server in order to support _just enough app-server_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the app-server is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of functionality, such as _Swagger_, _Jolokia_ or _NetflixOSS Ribbon_.

== What's New in 1.0.0.Alpha7?

There's slightly less stuf in this release since 1.0.0.Alpha6, but then
again, it marks our new trend of fortnightly releases.

* Swagger UI
* Generalize service-discovery topology SPI
* Service-discovery via link:http://consul.io/[Consul]

== Important Changes

In addition to the new features and bug-fixes, there are some notable changes
that you will need to undertake for your application since 1.0.0.Alpha6.

=== Topology

We've split topology bits away from the Ribbon support.  That includes
replacing `ribbon-webapp` with `topology-webapp` and changing the 
Javascript to `topology.js`.

=== Changelog

Release notes for 1.0.0.Alpha7 are available ##INSERT LINK##

=== Staffing

As you may know, the development of WildFly Swarm is supported by
http://redhat.com/[Red Hat].  Ken Finnigan has joined the project
as co-lead, and Heiko Braun has moved over from WildFly proper 
to help us bridge the gaps.

Welcome aboard!

=== Resources

Per usual, we tend to hang out on `irc.freenode.net` in `#wildfly-swarm`.

We've moved all bug and feature-tracking to http://issues.jboss.org/browse/SWARM[JIRA].

Examples are available in http://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-examples.

Documentation for this release is http://wildfly-swarm.io/documentation/1-0-0-Alpha7[available].
