One of the easiest ways to include source code in your WildFly
Swarm blog posts is by using the `metalsmith-gist` plugin. You
don't need to know anything about the plugin to use it though,
so don't worry.

To use the plugin, just add a `gist` property to the front matter
of your file. Then you can insert the gist anywhere you like in
the body of the file. Like so:

gist:lance/bdceac5f307f50723d78

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Praesent
in aliquet eros, vel posuere mi. Suspendisse a orci eu sapien
accumsan ullamcorper. Nunc scelerisque, purus vitae aliquam
