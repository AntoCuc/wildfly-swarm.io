== November means the release of 2016.11.0!

Celebrating National Pepper Month, at least for some nations,
we're happy to announce the release of WildFly Swarm version
2016.11.0.

=== What's New?

* New JAXRS client library
* Support for FlyWay schema migration for relational databases
* Improved Arquillian testing (still in progress)

=== What is WildFly Swarm?

WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
http://www.wildfly.org[WildFly Java Application Server] in order to support _just enough appserver_
for microservice type applications.

Each portion of the appserver is referred to as a _fraction_, which many times
maps to a `subsystem` from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of non-Java EE or WIldFly functionality, such as _Swagger_, _Jolokia_ or _NetflixOSS Ribbon_.

== JAXRS Client

KEN

== FlyWay integration

Flyway is an open-source database migration tool. It strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration.
We've introduced a new `flyway` fraction that automatically executes your SQL scripts located in `src/main/resources/db/migration` when your microservice starts. Check this https://github.com/wildfly-swarm/wildfly-swarm-examples/tree/2016.11.0/flyway[example] and read more about Flyway https://flywaydb.org/documentation/[here].

== Improved Arquillian

While we continue to improve our testing story with Arquillian, the biggest
visible change in this release the availability of `@DefaultDeployment` 
annotation.  This annotation may be applied at the _class_ level of your
test, and removes the need to provide a static method marked `@Deployment`
constructing your deployment.  It attempts to construct a reasonable default
deployment so that you don't have to.
