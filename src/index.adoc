== Java EE Microservices

WildFly Swarm allows you to build Java EE based microservices with
just enough of the application server to support whatever subset
of the traditional Java EE APIs your application requires.

Specify at build time just what bits of the AS you need.  The result
is a single self-contained _uberjar_. This jar contains your
application, the portions of WildFly required to support it, an
internal Maven repository of dependencies, plus a shim to bootstrap it
all.

A single executable that has no external dependencies and fits nicely
into your CI work chain. Run it like so...

    $ java -jar myApp-swarm.jar
