== Overview

In the beginning you should make yourself familiar with the monolith.
See what components exists, what Java EE APIâ€™s are used and how it spreads across the conceptual layers.

Before we tackle the microservices architecture, we would need to decouple the components,
separate the responsibilities and provide a build system that allows you to begin working on the separate services. *This part has been done already on your behalf to save time and allow the you to focus on more interesting topics*.

NOTE: The resulting module structure can be found in the folder `microservice` of `step_1`, which is what we operate on throughout the following activities.
