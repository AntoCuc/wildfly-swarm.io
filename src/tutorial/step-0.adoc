= Step 0: Creating a manageable codebase

= Step 0: Creating a manageable codebase

== Overview
To get started it might a good to first look at the monolith.
See what components exists, what Java EE APIâ€™s are used and how it spreads across the conceptual layers.
Before we tackle our microservices architecture, we would  need to decouple the components,
separate the responsibilities and provide a build system that allows you to begin working on the separate services.

This part has been done already on your behalf to save time and allow the you to focus on more interesting topics.

NOTE: The resulting module structure can be found in the folder `microservice`, which is what we operate on throughout the following activities.
