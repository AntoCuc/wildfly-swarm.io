= Step 3: Container API, Fractions and Deployments

Fractions and custom Main().  JAR deployment instead of WAR. Basically leaving the auto-detection realm.
A good opportunity to replace the simple service registration implementation with the Swarm Topology fraction. This allows to discover the fraction concept along the way.

== Concepts
* Container, Config-API
* Explicit fraction dependencies
* Introduction to Shrinkwrap and it’s utility methods


== Tasks
* Add the maven dependencies for fractions your application requires
(`jaxrs-jaxb`, `jaxrs-jsonp`, `jpa`, `jaxrs-cdi`, `ejb`)
* Add the maven dependency for the Swarm topology (`topology-consul`)
* Provide a custom `Main()` to configure the Swarm runtime
* Within Main() explicitly register the consul fraction and make sure it is configured to point to `http://<CONSUL_IP:8500”`.
* Deploy your service code using Shrinkwrap
* Advertise your service using the Swarm topology layer (`topology-consul`)
  (Allows for removal of the custom service registration code in the `services` module)

== Outcome
* You can still start the services as before (java -jar)
* Each service you start will be appear in Consul as before
* The user interface that remained on WildFly still works as expected

== Alternative activities
* Add and configure logging fraction, i.e. to enable level DEBUG
