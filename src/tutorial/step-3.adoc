= Step 3: Container API, Fractions and Deployments

= Step 3: Container API, Fractions and Deployments

In the previous step, we used the Swarm maven plugin to build the Uberjar's. The plugin added the required fractions to enable your application. In some cases however that's not possible, i.e. for API's beyond Java EE or when you need to configure the fraction explicitly. In these cases you would need to provide a custom `Main()` to configure and bootstrap Swarm.

To explain the the fraction concept and it's usage within `Main()`, we replace the current service registration code with the Swarm Topology fraction.

== Concepts
* Container, Config-API
* Explicit fraction dependencies
* Introduction to Shrinkwrap and it’s utility methods


== Tasks
* Add the maven dependencies for fractions that your application requires to each service module
(`jaxrs-jaxb`, `jaxrs-jsonp`, `jpa`, `jaxrs-cdi`, `ejb`)
* Add the maven dependency for the Swarm topology (`topology-consul`)
* Change the maven packaging from `war` to `jar`
* Provide a custom `Main()` to configure the Swarm runtime
* Within `Main()` explicitly register the consul fraction and make sure it is configured to point to `http://<CONSUL_IP:8500”`.
* Deploy your application code using Shrinkwrap
* Advertise your service using the Swarm topology layer (`topology-consul`)
  (Allows for removal of the custom service registration code in the `services` module)

== Outcome
* You can still start the services as before (java -jar)
* Each service you start will be appear in Consul as before
* The user interface that remained on WildFly still works as expected

== Alternative activities
* Add and configure logging fraction, i.e. to enable level DEBUG
