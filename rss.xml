<h3 id="_impact_of_the_repository_reorganization">Impact of the repository reorganization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuing in our trend of announcing versions that are arbitrarily
larger than our last release, we’re happy to announce <strong>1.0.0.Beta6</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As usual, beware the Ides of March.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted <a href="/posts/reorganization/">previously</a>, we’ve broken the codebase
into discrete chunks, each with its own release cycle.  <em>This</em> release represents
a released version of the aggregating BOM, which encompasses all of the various
released components.</p>

<p>After some hearty discussion at our face-to-face meeting in Newcastle, UK,
along with continuing that discussion on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wildfly-swarm">Google Group</a>,
we’ve decided to split apart our monolithic repository into reasonable slices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of the motivation for this split is related to how we version things.  Since
WildFly Swarm is a fairly quickly-moving project, at least in the near term,
there would always be some components in <code>alpha</code> or <code>beta</code> phase, preventing
the entirety from being released as <code>final</code>.  Especially given that WildFly Swarm
is an integration project, the upstream components we integrate with all have
varying release schedules, and timing a collective release can be difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To that end, each of the repositories below is roughly linked with its
upstream components and can produce independently-versioned bits of
WildFly Swarm.  Now, a release of <strong>WildFly Swarm</strong> will actually be composed
of a matrix of releases of the various sub-components, not necessarily matching
in version numbering.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since a multitude of versions can certainly make life more difficult for
consumers, we’ve added a BOM strategy (see <em>Practical Changes</em> below).</p>

<h3 id="_swagger_support_for_jax_rs_applications">Swagger Support for JAX-RS Applications</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the release of 1.0.0-Alpha8, WildFly Swarm has introduced support
for Swagger, a simple but powerful JSON representation of your REST
APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In simple terms, Swagger is a JSON representation of a RESTful API,
typically made available over HTTP at <code>/swagger.json</code>. This JSON
document contains information about your APIs, including names, paths,
endpoints, parameters, descriptions, keywords, expected responses, and
more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Per the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">Open API
Specification</a>, the goal of Swagger is to "define a standard,
language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and
computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service
without access to source code, documentation, or through network
traffic inspection".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this is your first encounter with Swagger, I suggest you head on
over to the <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger website</a> to learn more about
Swagger itself, and what it can do for you.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The common and only way to configure wildfly-swarm nodes was to use the Java API.
With the inclusion of <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/SWARM-14">SWARM-14</a>, external, declarative configuration of wildfly-swarm nodes becomes possible.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_wildfly_swarm">What is WildFly Swarm?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WildFly Swarm is the decomposition and reconstitution of the popular
WildFly Java Application Server in order to support <em>just enough app-server</em>
for microservice type applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each portion of the app-server is referred to as a <em>fraction</em>, which many times
maps to a <code>subsystem</code> from WildFly, but also may include other discrete chunks
of functionality, such as <em>Swagger</em>, <em>Jolokia</em> or <em>NetflixOSS Ribbon</em>.</p>
